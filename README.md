# Git Icon for Windows 10
A Git Repository icon in the style of Windows 10 folder icons. I may also eventually include icons for Windows 7 & 8, as well as Mac OS X.

## Installation

 1. Download git.ico
 2. Place git.ico in a location that it won't be deleted. I'd recommend at C:/Windows/System32/, as that's where most of the icons in Windows are stored.
 3. Browse to your user folder (winkey + r, %userprofile%, enter)
 4. Create a new folder titled "Repositories"
 5. Right click on this new folder, and click on "Properties."
 6. Change to the "Customize" tab, then click "Change Icon..."
 7. Click "Browse," and select your icon.
 8. Click "OK" then "Apply."

## Resources
 - folder.ico extracted from Windows 10's shell32.dll
 - Git logo pulled from [Git's official site](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads/logos).
